# HonoursProject
This is my repostitory for my honours project. It served as a backup of my development of the project. As such commit history will be messy and rough. 

The project is an attempt of making a native andorid app in order to learn more about NoSQL databases and working with one (in this case Firestore).

<b>The database has been taken offline so the app will not function as inteded. Instead you can get an idea of what the app is like from the images directory.
